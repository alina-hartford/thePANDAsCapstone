# Tech Catalyst Data Engineering Final Capstone - The PANDAS 
### Project Overview
For our capstone project, we were tasked with creating a full ETL pipeline using High Volume for-Hire (HVFHV) data, Yellow Taxi data, and Green Taxi data. Our goal was to extract data from a raw AWS S3 bucket, clean up the data, and load back into a conformed S3 bucket. Once doing that, we had to perform necessary transformations and load it back into a transformed S3 bucket, from which we loaded into Snowflake for final analysis before visualizing. We leveraged various AWS services and tools, such as AWS S3, AWS Glue Crawler, AWS Athena, Databricks/PySpark, Snowflake, and Thoughtspot. 

### Problem Statement
For our use case, we decided to focus more specifically on traffic congestion pattern analysis within New York City boroughs and the impact of tourism rates on these patterns. To do this, we leveraged the taxi datasets given to us, as well as explored external data that was used to supplement our analysis, visualizations, and solutions.
